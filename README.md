## Setup And Installation 

* Run `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.
* Start the server in Production mode run `npm run start` and to start in Development mode just simply run `npm run dev` that's pretty much it.
* Make sure that `disable` the value of <b>Block insecure private network</b> in `chrome://flags` to avoid <b>Same-Origin Policy</b> problems in browser. After that don't forget to set that back to the `default` value.
